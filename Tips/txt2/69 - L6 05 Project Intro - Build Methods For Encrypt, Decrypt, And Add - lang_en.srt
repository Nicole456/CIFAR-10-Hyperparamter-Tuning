1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,025
So in this next project,

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,320
I'd like if you to take the raw protocol you just learned

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,080
about and create several functions which are implemented.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,420
First, create a method called encrypt which accepts two input parameters,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,770
the number to be encrypted,

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,810
and the number of shares to be split into,

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,715
and returns a tuple of shares.

8
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:20,640
Second, create a method called decrypt which

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,210
accepts as input a tuple of shares and returns the decrypted value.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,010
Finally, create a method called add which accepts two tuples of shares and returns

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,380
a single tuple shares which are added correctly

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,155
according to the protocol specified in the previous concept.

13
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,060
Good luck, and I'll see you in the next concept.
