00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
In this lesson, we're going to get into the mid of

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,680
developing differentially private algorithms.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,900
The main strategy that we're going to take to protect

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,495
individual's privacy is one of noise,

5
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:12,839
meaning we're going to add random noise to the database

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,590
and to the queries in the database in order to protect people's privacy.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,410
Now, there are two different kinds of differential privacy, which

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,100
refer to the two different places that you can add noise.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,205
Local differential privacy adds noise to each individual data point.

10
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:31,460
You can think of this as adding noise directly to the database or

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,700
even having individuals add noise to their own data,

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,010
before even putting it into the database.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,250
In this setting, users are most protected as they

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,700
do not have to trust the database owner to use their data responsibly.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,140
The other kind of differential privacy is called global differential privacy,

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,775
which adds noise to the output of the query on the database.

17
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:58,505
This means that the database itself contains all of the private information and that it's

18
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,445
only the interface to the data which

19
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:05,000
adds the noise necessary to protect each individual's privacy.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,060
So what is the real difference between local and global differential privacy?

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,385
Well, if the database operator is trustworthy,

22
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:16,910
the only difference is that global differential privacy leads to

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,130
more accurate results with the same level of privacy protection.

24
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,980
However, this requires database owner to be trustworthy.

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,880
Namely, that the database owner should add noise properly.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,750
In differential privacy literature,

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,920
the database owner is called a trusted curator.
