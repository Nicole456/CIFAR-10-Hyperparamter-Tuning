1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
In this next project,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,725
I want you to change this query and soup it up a bit.

3
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:06,510
This is a pretty challenging project.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,810
This will be tough but the idea behind this project is

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,500
you get an intuitive sense for exactly what's going on under the hood,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,335
and how the re-normalizing step is going to happen.

7
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,180
So what I'd like for you to do is to augment

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,090
the randomized response query from the previous project,

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,825
to allow for varying amounts of randomness to be added.

10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:29,790
Specifically, I want you to be able to bias the first coin flip to be

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,830
higher or lower probability of outputting a one and then run the same experiment.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,135
So what you're going to have to do here is to add a new parameter to the query function,

13
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:43,010
so that we'll now accept both of the database and some noise parameter,

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,270
which is a percentage.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,460
The noise parameter should change how likely is for the first coin flip to be a one,

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,205
as opposed to zero.

17
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,450
Then, I want you to properly re-balanced

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,540
the result of the query given this adjustable parameter.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,285
So again, this is a challenging project and of course,

20
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,809
I'd like for you to go ahead and experiment with a database of size a 100,

21
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,940
and then change the amount of noise and observe

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,820
the degree to which the query is made less accurate,

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,960
depending on how much noise you add.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,130
Stick with it. It might not be one that everyone gets the first time,

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,170
but go ahead and jump in and in a second,

26
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,480
I'll show you how to implement this project myself.
