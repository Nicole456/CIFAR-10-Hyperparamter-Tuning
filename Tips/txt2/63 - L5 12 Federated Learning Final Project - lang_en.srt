1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,305
Now this brings us to your final project for course two.

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:07,155
Your final project is to do Federated Learning,

3
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:10,440
where the central server is not trusted with the raw gradients.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,150
In this final project notebook,

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,680
you'll receive a data set,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,160
and I want you to train on the data set using Federated Learning.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,040
However, the gradients should not come up to the central server in raw form.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,340
Instead, you should use this new.move for command,

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,265
to move all of the gradients to one of the workers,

10
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:30,675
sum them up there,

11
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,375
and then bring that batch up to the central server.

12
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,470
The idea here is that the central server never

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,755
actually sees the raw gradient for any person.

14
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,945
Now you might be asking yourself, "Wait,

15
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:45,505
but that means one of the workers sees the rock gradients."

16
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:47,700
Well, we'll get to that in course three

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,165
when we look at various forms of secure aggregation.

18
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,875
But for now, I want you to,

19
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,150
in this last project,

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,775
do a larger-scale Federated Learning case

21
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,280
where you handle the gradients in a special way.

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,210
Good luck, and I'll see you in the next course.
