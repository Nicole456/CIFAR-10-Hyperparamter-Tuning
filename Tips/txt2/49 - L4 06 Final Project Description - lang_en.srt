00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,785
In this first project,

2
00:00:01,785 --> 00:00:03,690
you will be given two things.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,610
First, you'll be given a series of

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,780
labelled private datasets which you must keep differentially private.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,130
Second, you'll be given

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,985
a public unlabeled dataset which you do not need to keep differentially private.

7
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:17,250
Your goal is to use the technique described in

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,805
the last lesson to automatically label the second dataset.

9
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:24,420
You should then be able to train a model on this second public dataset and get

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,220
a reasonable level of accuracy on the task given a certain epsilon delta constraint.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,940
Good luck in your project, and I'll see you in the next course.
