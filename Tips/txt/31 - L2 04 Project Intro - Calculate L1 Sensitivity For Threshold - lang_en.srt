00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,265
Okay. So in project three,

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:05,400
I'd like for you to play around with this notion of sensitivity yourself.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,740
Specifically, I'd like for you to calculate

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,100
the sensitivity for this new function, which is the threshold function.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,710
This project is going to take three steps.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,580
First, create the query function, where you compute the sum over

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,680
the database and return whether that sum is

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,260
greater than or less than a certain threshold.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,290
Then, I want you to create 10 databases of

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,530
size 10 and query them with a threshold of five,

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,780
calculating the sensitivity of each.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,215
Finally, I want you to print out the sensitivity of

13
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:37,800
all 10 databases so you can see them compared to each other.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,920
Good luck and I'll see you in the next concept.
