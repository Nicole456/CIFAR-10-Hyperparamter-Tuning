00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
What I'd like for you to do in the next project is consolidate the code that I

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,405
showed you in the last concept into a single function called sensitivity.

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:10,860
It should accept a function,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,765
the query, as input,

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:16,845
as well as the number of entries that you want to run this database over.

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:21,015
This function should then initialize a database of the appropriate size,

7
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:23,685
initialize all of the parallel databases,

8
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:26,160
run the query over the entire database,

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,139
and all parallel databases and correctly calculate the sensitivity of the function,

10
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,930
which as you may remember is the maximum distance between

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,950
the full database query output and any parallel database.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,340
Good luck and I'll see you in the next concept.
