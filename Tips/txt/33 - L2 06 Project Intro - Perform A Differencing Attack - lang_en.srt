1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,235
In this concept, we're going to explore how to compromise or attack differential privacy.

2
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,050
In particular, we want to talk about

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,575
the simplest attack, which is called a differencing attack.

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:14,730
Sadly, none of the functions we've looked at so far are differentially private,

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,340
despite them having varying levels of sensitivity.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,345
We're going to demonstrate this here by using this differencing attack.

7
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:25,380
So let's say we want to figure out a specific person's value in the database.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,535
If we're able to perform a query using a sum,

9
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,400
all we would have to do is query for the sum of

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,515
the entire database and then the sum of the entire database without that person.

11
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:39,950
In SQL, this might look something like this.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,505
As you can see, by comparing these two SQL queries,

13
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:47,150
we can determine whether John Doe actually had cancer.

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,910
So what I'd like for you to do in the next project is

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,670
perform this differencing attack using the sum,

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,865
mean, and threshold query functions we already created.

17
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,730
The purpose of this exercise is to give you an intuition for

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,680
how privacy can fail in these environments.
