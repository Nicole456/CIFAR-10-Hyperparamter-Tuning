In this first project,
you will be given two things.
First, you'll be given a series of
labelled private datasets which you must keep differentially private.
Second, you'll be given
a public unlabeled dataset which you do not need to keep differentially private.
Your goal is to use the technique described in
the last lesson to automatically label the second dataset.
You should then be able to train a model on this second public dataset and get
a reasonable level of accuracy on the task given a certain epsilon delta constraint.
Good luck in your project, and I'll see you in the next course.
